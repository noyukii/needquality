# Design It Twice

When the user wants to explore alternative interfaces for a chosen deepening
candidate, produce independent designs. Use parallel workers when available;
otherwise draft the variants sequentially with distinct constraints and keep
their notes separate. Never claim parallel work when it did not occur. Based
on "Design It Twice" (Ousterhout): your first idea is unlikely to be the best.

Uses the vocabulary in [flow](../codebase-design.md): **module**, **interface**, **seam**, **adapter**, **leverage**.

## Process

### 1. Frame the problem space

Before producing designs, write a user-facing explanation of the problem space
for the chosen candidate:

- The constraints any new interface would need to satisfy
- The dependencies it would rely on, and which category they fall into (see [DEEPENING.md](DEEPENING.md))
- A rough illustrative code sketch to ground the constraints, not a proposal, just a way to make the constraints concrete

Show this to the user, then immediately proceed to Step 2. Use independent
workers when available and useful; otherwise keep each design in a separate
sequential pass.

### 2. Produce independent designs

Create 3+ **radically different** interfaces. Prefer parallel independent
workers; use sequential passes when workers are unavailable.

Give each worker or sequential design pass a separate technical brief (file
paths, coupling details, dependency category from
[DEEPENING.md](DEEPENING.md), and what sits behind the seam). Keep it
independent of the user-facing explanation in Step 1. Use a different design
constraint for each pass:

- Agent 1: "Minimize the interface: aim for 1–3 entry points max. Maximise leverage per entry point."
- Agent 2: "Maximise flexibility: support many use cases and extension."
- Agent 3: "Optimise for the most common caller: make the default case trivial."
- Agent 4 (if applicable): "Design around ports & adapters for cross-seam dependencies."

Include both [flow](../codebase-design.md) vocabulary and CONTEXT.md vocabulary in the brief so each sub-agent names things consistently with the architecture language and the project's domain language.

Each design pass outputs:

1. Interface (types, methods, params, plus invariants, ordering, error modes)
2. Usage example showing how callers use it
3. What the implementation hides behind the seam
4. Dependency strategy and adapters (see [DEEPENING.md](DEEPENING.md))
5. Trade-offs: where leverage is high, where it's thin

### 3. Present and compare

Present designs sequentially so the user can absorb each one, then compare them in prose. Contrast by **depth** (leverage at the interface), **locality** (where change concentrates), and **seam placement**.

After comparing, give your own recommendation: which design you think is strongest and why. If elements from different designs would combine well, propose a hybrid. Be opinionated: the user wants a strong read, not a menu.
